        <h2>Lines</h2>
        <p>Lines are strokes connecting two points, and the most basic element of visual design. We can use them to create shapes, and when we repeat them, we can form patterns that create textures.</p>

        <h2>Shapes</h2>
        <p>Shapes are self-contained areas, usually formed by lines (although they may also be formed by using a different colour, value or texture). A shape has two dimensions: length and width.</p>

        <h2>Negative space</h2>
        <p>Negative space (also known as white space) is the empty area around a (positive) shape. The relation between the shape and the space is called figure/ground, where the shape is the figure and the area around the shape is the ground. We should be aware that when designing positive shapes, we are also designing negative spaces at the same time. Negative space is just as important as the positive shape itself â€” because it helps to define the boundaries of the positive space and brings balance to a composition.</p>

        <h2>Volume</h2>
        <p>Volume applies to visuals that are three-dimensional and have length, width and depth. We rarely use volume in visual design, because most digital products end up being viewed on a 2D screen, although some apps and websites do use 3D models and graphics. (Technically, though, 3D images viewed on a 2D screen are still 2D images.)</p>      </div>

        <h2>Value</h2>
        <p>Value, quite simply, describes light and dark.</p>

        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>Color is an element of light. Colour theory is a branch of design focused on the mixing and usage of different colours in design and art. In colour theory, an important distinction exists between colours that mix subtractively and colours that mix additively.</p>
