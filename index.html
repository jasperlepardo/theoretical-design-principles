      <p>Arguably the most stirring of colors, red’s effects on the psyche are not subtle. It’s therefore important that it be used carefully for branding purposes. Red has been shown to reduce analytical thinking—it speeds up and intensifies our reactions. There’s a reason why clearance sale prices are put on red tags. Athletes up against opponents wearing red are more likely to lose, and students tend to perform worse on tests if exposed to red beforehand. Red, after all, is the color of stop signs, grammatical mistakes, and negative finances. Red has the longest wavelength of all the colors, and so appears to be nearer than it actually is. It is the color of passion and romance. Red tends to increase the appetite and is used in a range of colorful terms centered on excitement: red-hot, red-handed, paint the town red, seeing red. Inside the U.S. red is associated with conservatism. Outside the country, it’s long been the banner color for communism and socialism. Other emotional traits linked to red include the following.</p>

      <p>Red has the longest wavelength of the colours on the spectrum. and it is a colour that really captures your attention. It is the primary branding colour for a lot of success stories, including Coca Cola, Ferrari F1 and Manchester United. Red is aggressive, exciting, passionate, dangerous and energetic.</p>
      
      <p>In UI, red is also used as a primary warning or error colour. For this reason, it’s best to use red sparingly. Using it as your primary button or typography colour might confuse users if it’s also being used as a warning sign.</p>

      <p>At the crossroads of red and yellow sits orange. Orange is stimulatory, conjuring feelings of excitement, enthusiasm, and warmth. It is a fun, energetic hue found in the branding of many sports teams. Not unlike red or yellow, orange is used to draw attention—in traffic cones and advertising collateral. Consumers tend to associate the color orange with value, in fact, a reality that brands like Home Depot have capitalized on. On the physical end of the spectrum it evokes comfort like food, warmth, and shelter. It is the color of sunset, citrus, and pumpkins, forever linked to fall and Halloween for American customers. This is especially the case when it is paired with black, which lends it a tone of cartoonish dread and frivolity. Emotions central to the color orange comprise the following.</p>
      <p>Next on the spectrum, we have orange. Nickelodeon, Fanta and Amazon are brands that use orange to communicate a fun, fresh and attractive brand. Orange is creative, successful and enthusiastic. It is less less serious and commanding than red, but less carefree than yellow.</p>
      <p>It is for this reason that orange makes a great colour for online ordering. Orange attracts our eye without warning or overwhelming us.</p>

      <p>The color green is the easiest on our eyes because it requires no adjustment when it hits the retina. It’s therefore calming, restful, and pleasing. Performers waiting to go on stage or television wait in “green rooms” to relax. Green can actually improve vision, and is used in night vision because our eyes can discern the most shades of it. Sitting comfortably in the middle of the spectrum, green is the color of balance. It represents nature, fertility, and even sexuality. The myth of the green M&M is an enduring one. A green world is a safe world, one that is lush, full of water, and life-giving. For this reason it’s a reassuring color. Like all colors, though, green has its negative side. It is at once the symbol of health and sickness, luck and jealousy. The list of green’s emotive attributes includes:</p>
      <p>Green is the colour of growth, fertility, health and nature. It is also the colour of wealth. Spotify and Starbucks use green in their logo to communicate youth and freshness.</p>
      <p>If your project is about health, fitness or well-being, there is a great opportunity to use soft greens with natural, earthy tones.</p>
      <p>Green is also the ‘go’ colour for a lot of people, as this is it’s meaning on road signs around Europe and North America. Green is a great colour to use for buttons, success messages and positive notifications. When the user has correctly entered their information, you might let them know in green.</p>

      <p>Where red is the color of the body, blue is evokes the mind. Serene and calming, it is the color of clarity and communication. According to color psychology studies, blue has been shown to be the most common favorite color among the world’s population, and is particularly preferred by men. It is, of course, everywhere in our daily lives. It’s the color of the sky, the oceans, and the lakes. This global preference and environmental omnipresence makes blue non-threatening, conservative, and traditional. Brands are not taking any risks when they call on a shade of blue for their identity. It is seen as a sign of stability and reliability, and it’s been shown that workers are more productive in blue rooms. Blue, of course, is also the color of sadness and coldness. It is among the least appetizing of colors as it is an indicator of spoilage and poison. Weight loss plans suggest you eat food off a blue plate as you’re liable to eat less of it. Across the spectrum, blue’s emotional attributions include:</p>
      <p>Blue is the colour of the sea and the sky. It is harmony, peace, calm and relaxation. Using soft blue has a calming influence, and a strong vibrant blue is energetic.</p>
      <p>Blue is a very prominent colour in social media and communication companies like Facebook, Twitter and Skype.</p>
      <p>Health and hygiene companies use blue to promote freshness and cleanliness. Blue is also used to promote trust and security. A lot of universities use blue on their diploma certificates, and policemen wear blue.</p>

      <p>Not quite red and not quite purple, Magneta is very much its own hue with a slew of distinct and psychological implications. Magenta is a color of emotional balance and physical harmony. It’s sophisticated yet pragmatic, evocative of logic and perspicacity. Magenta is redolent of compassion, support, and kindness, and is associated with feelings of self-respect and contentment. It’s a color of transformation, suggesting the sloughing off of old ideas and the embrace of new ones. It retains a certain level of boldness from red and can thusly appear either outrageous and shocking or innovative and imaginative, depending on the context. Magenta is well suited to creative, nonconformist endeavors. The psychological implications of magenta include the following:</p>
      <p>Pink is feminine, soft and romantic. It’s the colour of brands that serve female customers. Benefit cosmetics, Victoria’s Secret and Barbie are synonymous with the colour pink.</p>
      <p>Pink is also a colour of love. It’s playful and humorous, communicating lightheartedness and fun. Avoid using pink if your content is serious.</p>
      <p>If your content is fun, pink makes a great primary button colour, particularly when it’s offset against a dark background. Vibrant shades of pink can be very fresh and eye-catching, while softer ones can be calm and understated.</p>

        <h2 class="title">What is Gestalt?</h2>
        <p>Gestalt (form, shape in German) is a group of visual perception principles developed by German psychologists in 1920s. It is built on the theory that “an organized whole, is perceived as greater than the sum of its parts”.</p>

        <p>We can use the Proximity principle in UI design for grouping similar information, organising content and decluttering layouts. Its correct use will have a positive impact on visual communication and user experience.</p>
        <p>As the principle states, items that are related should stay close to each other, while the unrelated items should stay further apart. White space plays a vital role here as it creates contrast guiding the users’ eyes in the intended direction. White space can boost visual hierarchy and information flow, contributing in easy to read and scan layouts. It will help users achieve their goals faster and delve deeper into the content.</p>

        <p>The Common Region principle is particularly useful. It can help with information grouping and content organisation, but it can also achieve content separation or act as a focal point. It boosts hierarchy, scanability and assists in promoting information.</p>
        <p>The Common Region principle can hold together many different elements keeping them unified within larger groups. We can achieve it with the use of line, colour, shape and shadow. It can often be used to bring elements into the foreground, indicating interaction or importance.</p>

        <h2 class="title">How does the Similarity principle apply to UI design?</h2>
        <p>We tend to perceive similar to each other elements as grouped or a pattern. We also might think that they serve the same purpose. Similarity can help us with organising and classifying objects within a group and linking them with a specific meaning or function.</p>
        <p>There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape). When Similarity occurs, an object can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called ‘Anomaly’ and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user’s attention to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow.</p>

        <p>As the Closure principle states, when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole. This way we can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate information, reducing complexity and making designs more engaging. Closure can help us minimise visual noise and convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a pretty small space.</p>

        <p>Symmetrical elements are simple, harmonious and visually pleasing. Our eyes seek those attributes along with order and stability, to make sense of the world. For this reason, Symmetry is a useful tool for communicating information quickly and efficiently. Symmetry feels comfortable helping us focus on what’s important.</p>
        <p>Symmetrical compositions are satisfying, but they can also get a bit dull and static. Visual symmetry tends to be more dynamic, and interesting. Adding an asymmetrical element to an otherwise symmetrical design can help with drawing attention while making an impression; something useful for any point of interest or a Call To Action, for example. Symmetry, along with a healthy amount of asymmetry is important in any design.</p>

        <p>Continuity helps us interpret direction and movement through a composition. It takes place when aligning elements and it can help our eyes move smoothly through the page, assisting with legibility. The Continuity principle strengthens the perception of grouped information, creating order and guiding users through different content segments.

        <p>Regardless of how far apart are the elements or how dissimilar they might appear, if they are moving or changing together, they are perceived as related. This effect can take place even when movement is implied, by other visual elements.</p>
        <p>The Common Fate principle is more potent when elements move synchronised; in the same direction and at the same time and speed. It can help with grouping relevant information and linking actions with results. The disruption of a synchronised movement can grab users’ attention and direct it to a specific element or feature. It can also, establish relationships between different groups or states.</p>

  <section>
    <h2 class="title">Keep the Number of Fonts Used at a Minimum</h2>
    <p>Using more than three typefaces simultaneously can make your app/site look busy and unstructured. It’s better to limit the number of used font families to a minimum (two is plenty, one is often sufficient) and stick to the same ones through the entire website/app.</p>
    <h3>Start by selecting a typeface for your body text</h3>
    <p>This is a very important decision which will affect the decisions of any other typeface like headlines. Body text is the most common element in a product. This is what all your users will see and experience. As a result, the look and feel of your body text will have the greatest impact on the quality of your design.</p>
    <h3>Stay with one font until you master it</h3>
    <p>For beginners, it’s recommended to stay with one font until you have achieved mastery of that font. Play with the styles. Modern typefaces already come with many different styles, which means they share common distinct weights. Typefaces with a larger range of styles can help you differentiate text in special contexts, like a button or a label. A good example is San Francisco typeface from Apple.</p>
    <h3>Ensure font families complement each other</h3>
    <p>If you still want/need to use more than one font, ensure the font families complement each other. Take the example of fonts combinations below. The combination of Georgia and Verdana (left) share similar values that create a harmonious pairing. Compare that to the pairing of Baskerville and Impact (right) where the heavy weight of Impact vastly overshadows its counterpart.</p>
